# Binaural Beats Example App
For Android
Created by Russell Eric Dobda
Guided Meditation Treks

This is the core of the "Binaural" application, created by Russell Dobda in 2016
That was my first ever android app, and it generates sine waves to be used
for binaural beats.

This sample app is a cut-down version of that, 
which includes the core engine to create binaural beats.

Some background on the algorithms can be found here

The production app can be found on the Google Play store at
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guidedmeditationtreks.binaural

There is also an iOS app with the same name, which does the same thing

If you use any of these algorithms in your own binaural beats app, it would be cool to get a shout out!
